# Averagely
* ### In this development you can calculate the average score of the grades.

#### Types:
```C#
double & string 
```
#### Operators:
```C#
if(){...}
else{...}
```
The ***if-else*** construct is able to check one or more conditions, and if the condition is not true, then execute another code or check another condition.

```C#
switch
```
The ***switch*** statement provides multidirectional branching in the program.

#### Funstions:
```C#
Output to console: Console.WriteLine();
Input from console: Console.Readline();
Converts: double.Parse();
```
Also in the code i used ***Escape Characters*** - replacement of control characters in the text with corresponding text substitutions.
